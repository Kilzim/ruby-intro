# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 5
puts 2
puts 5 + 7
puts 5 / 7.0 
# If you want the exact number, one of the numbers needs a decimal (a.e 7.0 instead of only 7)
puts 5 * 7
puts 5 - 7
# Non-numbers
puts "hello world"
puts 'hello world'
puts "tacos are" + " delish!"
puts "tacos " * 3 + "delish!"
# True, False

puts 3 == 2
puts 3 == 3

# Nothing

# Variables
x = 5
y = 7

puts x+y

food = "tacos"
quantity = 3

puts "I want #{quantity} #{food}"
# # = option + 3, {} = option + 8/9

# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation
